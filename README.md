# BUAN3210-MidtermProject
A fictional company, Office Mate, wants to improve profitability. This project contains a full EDA and memo going over our suggestions to management.


This one the second of two group projects for this class. The repository contains a PDF regarding the instructions and column descriptions for the dataset (also included in the form of a CSV file). The memo contains some key visuals and our two suggestions to Office Mate management. The TA or technical appendix contains our full analysis, done in R markdown.
